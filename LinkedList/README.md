# This folder is about a Linked List
Creation of a linked list with the implementation of the methods:
* getTail( )
* getHead( )
* getLength( )
* makeEmpty( )
* print( )
* apprend( ) 
* removeLast( )
* prepend( )
* remove First( )
* insert( )
* set( )
* remove( )

### Notes

* I've also included a small example with the possibility of testing the other methods.
* I've tried to make the variables as intuitive as possible for anyone reading my code.  :)
