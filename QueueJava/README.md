# Holding a draw
 I added a context for use where I abstracted the realization of a draw where there were 10 random winners and that each of these winners withdrew their gift in the order of the first drawn to the last drawn.

In addition, Implementation of a queue data structure in Java with methods:
* int getNode( ); - returns the value of a Node.
* int getFirst( ); - return the value of the first queue.
* int getLast( ); - returns the value of the last queue.
* void println( ); - print all queue values.
* void getLength( ); - show the queue length.
* void enqueue(int value); - adds a new value to the last place in the queue.
* void dequeue( ); - removes first value from queue
